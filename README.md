Interactive documentation by Swagger is on `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` after starting server by `./gradlew bootRun`.
 But there is a bug and Swagger does not work with Spring boor 2 data rest. So only non repository endpoints are there.

Another documentation is generated by spring-restdocs: `./gradlew asciidoctor && xdg-open build/docs/html5/api-guide.html`

This documentation is generated at test phase so what is called in tests it is documented.

Due to time limits I implemented only several tests as an example. Other tests should by very similar. So only repository endpoints which are not covered by Swagger are tested and documented this way.
